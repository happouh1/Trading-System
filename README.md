# Trading System

Phase 1D foundation for a deterministic candle-by-candle trading research system.

The repository contains immutable contracts, canonical serialization, strict CSV/Parquet OHLCV
ingestion, XNYS session validation, deterministic 1H/4H/Daily/Weekly aggregation, causal streaming
features, confirmed structure, structural zones, pattern state machines, causal multi-timeframe
scoring, explained decisions, structural plans, simulated trade lifecycle events, deterministic
replay checkpoints, versioned outcomes, metrics, and bias-disclosed reports. It intentionally contains
no brokerage connectivity, live trading, options, or machine-learning authority.
